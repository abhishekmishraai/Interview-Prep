# Data-Science-Interview-Resources

Update : Drawing from extensive experience in interviews over the past few years, I recently decided to launch a dedicated channel to help individuals excel in Data Science. My goal is to create a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to revisit the basics before an upcoming interview or master the skills and in-depth knowledge required for both succeeding in Data Science interviews and applying Data Science in practice. This channel aims to provide a clear understanding of various techniques used on a day-to-day basis, covering a vast range of Machine Learning topics. Feel free to explore it here :

First of all, thanks for visiting this repo, congratulations on making a great career choice, I aim to help you land an amazing Data Science job that you have been dreaming for, by sharing my experience, interviewing heavily at both large product-based companies and fast-growing startups, hope you find it useful.

With an increase in demand for so many Data Scientists, itâ€™s really hard to successfully get screened and accepted for an interview. In this repo, I include everything from getting successfully screened and rocking that interview to land that amazing position, make sure to nail it with the following resources.

Every Resource I list here is personally verified by me and most of them I have used personally, which have helped me a lot.

Word of Caution: Data Science/Machine Learning has a very big domain and there are a lot of things to learn. This by no means is an exhaustive list and is just for helping you out if you are struggling to find some good resources to start your preparation. However, I try to cover and update this frequently and my goal is to cover and unify everything into one resource that you can use to rock those interviews!

Please leave a star if you appreciate the effort.
